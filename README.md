It educates users about various cryptocurrencies, allows users to add favorites, and refreshes with up to date market data each time a user reloads the home page. 

This project uses Python, Flask, Axios, SQL-Alchemy, CSS, Jinga-templates, and HTML. 

Bootstrap was used to make everything smooth and presentable.
